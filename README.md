# A script for creating a react app without CRA.

  This is a script to create a minimal react project without `create-react-app`, using just a simple `webpack` configuration. Just run the script and start creating react apps with all the freedom your creativity needs. :)

## How to use

To install you may use the following cURL command:
  ```sh
  /bin/bash <(curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/br08/react-boilerplate/main/install.sh)
  ```

Or you can download the script and run manually as well:
  
  ```sh
  chmod +x install.sh # give execution permission
  ./install.sh # run the script
  ```
  During the installation process you're going to be prompted to choose between `yarn` and `npm` to be the package manager for your project, as well as other questions like wether or not you want to use `typescript`.

And it's as simple as that!
