# A boilerplate project for creating a react app without CRA.

  As the description says, this is a boilerplate react project created without `create-react-app`, using just a simple `webpack` configuration with `babel` and `eslint`. Clone this project, change its name (not only the folder name, but the `name` property in `package.json` as well) and start creating react apps without all the unnecessary features.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository in your local machine:
  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/br08/react-boilerplate-project.git
  ```

2. Rename the project folder to your liking. Don't forget to rename the `name` property inside `package.json`, as well as all the other personal tags (`description`, `author`, `license`, etc).

3. Go to the folder and run the installation script.
  
  ```sh
  $ cd react-boilerplate-project # change this to your actual project name
  $ chmod +x install.sh # give execution permission
  $ ./install.sh # run the installer
  ```
  During the installation process you're going to be asked to choose between `yarn` and `npm` to be the package manager for your project.

  At the end, you're safe to delete the installation script, since you're not going to need to use it again.

4. Start creating awesome apps! :smiley:
